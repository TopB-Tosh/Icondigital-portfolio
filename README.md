## Projects

### Tiktok Project - Predictively Classifying videos as either claims or opinions using Machine learning.

 * Goal :
   
   Tiktok wanted to reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently. This will then help increase the response time and system efficiency by automating the initial stages of the claims process.
   
 * Role :
   
    Build a machine learning model that can be used to predict whethera Tiktok video presents a 'claim' or presents an 'opinion'.

### Airline Dataset - Building a decision tree model to predict customer satisfaction

 * Goal :
   
   The airline was interested inpredicting whether a future customer would be satisfied  with the services given using previous customer feedback about the flight experience.

 * Role :
   
    Conduct basic EDA, data cleaning and other manipulations to process and prepare the data for modelling a decision tree model. In addition Tune hyperparameters using 'GridSearchCV' then evaluate the decision tree modelusing a confusion matrix and other plots.

### Air Quality Data From ROA(Repair Our Air) USA - Hypothesis testing.

 * Goal :
   
   ROA were considering the following decisions

   a) A metropolitan approach focus, within california. They wanted to know if the mean AQI(air quality index) in Los Angeles county was statistically different from the rest of california.

   b) With limited resources, they had to choose between New York and Ohio for their next regional office. So did New York have a lower AQI than Ohio.

   c) A new policy would affect states with a mean AQI of 10 or greater. Would Michigan county be affected by this new policy.

 * Role :

   * I was tasked with leveraging the Air Quality Index data to help prioritize their strategy for improving air quality in America.

   * I Formulated a null and an alternative hypotheses
     
   * I also computed the p- values of the hypothesis tests
  
   when the p value is less than the significance level we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis
  AND
   when the p-value is more than 0.05 (as your significance level is 5%),do not reject the null hypothesis.

### Marketing Promotion Data - Advanced Hypothesis Testing.

 * Goal :
   
   The business uses TV, Social Media, radio and Influencer promotions to increase sales. Stakeholders wanted to know if sales were significantly different among various TV and Influencer promotion types.

 * Role :
   
   Having previously provided insights about how different promotion types affect sales. I started by using a one way ANOVA to help determine if there is a statistically significant difference in sales among groups.
   This would include;

                   ~ Use of plots and descriptive statistics to select a categorical independent variable

                   ~ Creating and fitting a linear regression model with selected categorical independent variable

                   ~ Checking model assumptions

                   ~ Performing and interpreting a one way ANOVA test.

                   ~ Result evaluation using a Turkeys HSD and a post hoc test

The first row, which compares the High and Low TV groups, indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the Sales of these two groups.
You can also reject the null hypotheses for the two other pairwise comparisons that compare High to Medium and Low to Medium.



### United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) - Exploring Probability distributions

 * Goal :

    EPA wanted to know which regions need support to make air quality improvements given that carbon monoxide is a major pollutant.

 * Role :

    I was tasked with investigating the air quality index with respect to carbon monoxide ;
   
        ~ Determine the type of  probability distribution best fits the data
   
        ~ Calculate the z - score, to help detect outliers or data points of regions that need support the most to improve their air quality.

There was a slight right skew, but it still appears to be a bell shape. This shape suggests that the distribution of this data should be approximately normal
